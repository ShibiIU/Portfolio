## [Project 1: Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/ShibiIU/Book-Recommendation-System)
- Processed, visualized, and analyzed more than 1 million book review data from a social networking website "BookCrossing.com”.
- Applied both the content-based filtering and collaborative filtering algorithms (KNN) to build recommendation systems that make book recommendations based on each user's taste and preference.
- Evaluated and compared the performance of the different book recommendation systems.

Here is an example output of the recommendation system:

## [Project 2: Model Selection for Influenza Infection Outbreaks](https://github.com/ShibiIU/Influenza-Outbreaks)
-	Employed Approximate Bayesian Computation and sequential Monte Carlo sampling to examine the spread patterns of influenza virus in Tecumseh, MI, and Seattle, WA, from 1975 to 1979.
-	Found that the different outbreaks of the same strain and the outbreaks of different strains of the influenza virus can not be described by the same model of disease spread.

## [Project 3: Domestic Spillovers and Foreign Networks in Exporting](https://ideas.repec.org/p/inu/caeprp/2018005.html)   
-	Cleaned and matched more than 16 million Colombian and Chilean trade data to construct firm-to-firm measures of the export network.
-	Applied Probit and Logit models to quantify the spillover and network effects on exporting firms’ entry into a new foreign market.
- Wrote a research paper and submitted it to a journal (under review).

## [Project 4: Firms’ Entry into Foreign Markets: A Network Centrality Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D2GoDL6mOkyTix89V4vlW7aMCl_hVLy4/view)
-	Using international trade data among 176 countries between 2007-2013 to construct a world-trade network. 
-	Computed various centrality measures and identified the central markets in the international trade. 
-	Built both theoretical and empirical models to show that exporting firms are more likely to enter foreign countries with high centrality in the world trade network.
