## [Project 1: Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/ShibiIU/Book-Recommendation-System)
- Processed, visualized, and analyzed more than 1 million book review data from a social networking website “Book-Crossing”.
- Used both the content-based filtering and collaborative filtering algorithms (KNN) to build book recommendation systems that recommend books based on individual user's taste and preference.
- Evaluated and compared the performance of the different book recommendation systems.
