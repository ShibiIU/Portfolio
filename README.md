## [Project 1: Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/ShibiIU/Book-Recommendation-System)
- Processed, visualized, and analyzed more than 1 million book review data from a social networking website "BookCrossing.com‚Äù.
- Applied both the content-based filtering and collaborative filtering algorithms (KNN) to build recommendation systems that make book recommendations based on each user's taste and preference.
- Evaluated and compared the performance of the different book recommendation systems.

Here is an example output of the recommendation system:

## [Project 2: Model Selection for Influenza Infection Outbreaks](https://github.com/ShibiIU/Influenza-Outbreaks)
-	Employed Approximate Bayesian Computation and sequential Monte Carlo sampling to examine the spread patterns of influenza virus in Tecumseh, MI, and Seattle, WA, from 1975 to 1979.
-	Found that the different outbreaks of the same strain and the outbreaks of different strains of the influenza virus can not be described by the same model of disease spread.
